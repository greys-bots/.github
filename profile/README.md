# Grey's Bots
Welcome! You've found the Github repo for all of the bots created by greysdawn/the Grey Skies. Everything publicly available is here- the only thing missing is commissioned bots

Here's some info about the bots here:

# Common features
## Built for Discord
All of the bots in here (as of writing) are built for Discord. All except two are currently using Discord.js specifically; those two are going to be rewritten soon. We're in the process of migrating everything to use integrations and app commands now, but in general **all of our bots are made to take full advantage of Discord's features.** That means that we do our best to integrate them seamlessly into the API and feature set that Discord provides

## Simple and easy to use
We strive to make our bots as accessible as possible. As part of that, all of our bots originally came with plenty of command aliases and simple syntax. Due to the slash commands overhaul, aliases aren't able to be used- but they still ship with documentation built into commands, easy syntax, and plenty of organization when it comes to command categories

## Feature rich - all for free
*Everything* we create here is free. To put it frankly, we hate putting things behind a paywall. We believe that users deserve to have a good and feature rich experience regardless of their current income or financial situation

To give some examples, here are some things we offer for free:
- [Form Fox](https://github.com/greys-bots/form-fox) has *unlimited* forms and responses, unlike many other form bots
- [Sheep](https://github.com/greys-bots/sheep) offers *unlimited* saved colors, in case you need a full rainbow for switching on the fly
- [Ticket Golem](https://github.com/greys-bots/ticket-golem) is only limited by the number of channels that can be in a category (and even then, you can create a new category for tickets- so it's really only limited by the total channel limit)
- [Ocelot](https://github.com/greys-bots/ocelot) is only limited by the number of roles you can have in a server

The only *specifically implemented* hard limits are either based on resource usage (eg. Sheep can only import 100 saved colors at once) or Discord limitations (eg. Fox's 20 questions limit), and we are working on removing or upping these limits all the time!

## Completely open source
You're here on Github! That means you can see the code for everything in this repo. It also means you can download that code and run it yourself- or even contribute to the repository with issues and pull requests. Nothing in our bots is hidden from the public, and the more recent ones have self hosting instructions for folks who want to take a crack at running their own versions of each bot
